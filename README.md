# Android-Development-with-App-Inventor

I f you want to start android development but want to avoid coding then look no furtherer than App Inventor.App Inventor for android is an open-source web application originally provided by Google, and now maintained by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
 
Here I created an awesome looking android weather application that has following features
 
Provides the weather information of users location along with description of current, tonights and tomorrows weather condition.
Has a text to speech feature which reads the weather report in one go.
application uses JSON data collected from http://www.weather.gov.
